=======================================
Collaboration Across a Global Business
=======================================

Software Development by itself is a process that demands **collaboration**. Even if there is only one developer,
it is imperative that he or she collaborates with the end user. Every developer writes software for a user. In some cases,
the user could be the developer himself. In most cases, it is someone else. Oftentimes, a person who may not understand the
process or its complications.

**A developer's customers could be anyone, anywhere, all across the organization.**

*Illustration 1: Customers for a Software Developer*

There are situations where a developer could collaborate with other developers as well.

*Illustration 2: Collaboration between Developers*

These software developers could be **exchanging ideas**, or they could be **jointly developing a massive application**.
Collaboration in software development has come a long way. People don't need to journey to a remote location to understand
a client's requirements. Indeed, there are millions of projects online where **developers collaborate without even meeting or
interacting at a personal level**.

This is made possible with the help of **modern development tools** and methologies, most of them **free, and open source**.

This document will showcase how teams can collaborate across the world. It will explain how the development process has
changed in today's world, and how we can catch up.

Software Development: Outline

Consider a simple software request.

*Illustration 3: A Simple Software Development Process*

This is a very simple process, stripped of its complications. However, look at the looped section. In even the simplest
requests, this section could get *very* complicated.

Novice programmers, fresh out of college, might keep copies of their code, going so far as to rename versions as ``_v1.c``, ``_v2.c`` or some such.
Others, who have some exposure to the world at large, will have encountered websites such as `Github <https://github.com>`_, `Gitlab <https://gitlab.com>`_ or `Atlassian Bitbucket <https://bitbucket.org>`_ during their studies
or personal research.

Some with a little experience may have come across ``Mercurial``, ``Subversion`` or even ``CVS``.
