Why We Must Embrace Open Source Software
=========================================

This section of the document seeks to alleviate the concerns large organizations usually have towards open source software.


---------
Low Cost
---------

Open Source software is usually free as well. But not necessarily. There are also software that you can install which have a software as a service model.
These companies will offer their software up for free, but if you want service, you'll have to pay. Often, this additional service is not required.

--------------------------------------
Proprietary Software is not Bug Free
--------------------------------------

Just because we pay for a licensing fee, we cannot immediately assume that a software our vendors deliver to us are developed with the
best practises at heart. Neither can we be sure that the most glaring bugs are fixed.

Open Source software does not hide its bugs or security flaws. Such flaws are immediately brought to the forefront, for the world to see. There is
nothing to hide.

----------------------------------
Algorithms Can Be Kept In-House
----------------------------------

By developing open source software, we do not need to necessarily show off our core business algorithms. The central algorithms can be preserved in house,
and only the generic logic can be exposed.

----------------------------
Arguments For Open Source
----------------------------

Open source software is usually the first to move to modern software development practises. It is easier to find open source software that follows
Test Driven Development. Closed source software is usually governed by archaic contracts, implementing age old principles that have expired in their
validity. Open Source tools are unbridled of technical debt or policy. Users can easily make changes and replicate the original author's testing environment
to see if their changes break anything.

----------------------------
Stand Among Giants
----------------------------

Some of the largest companies today deal with open source software. Google, Facebook, Amazon and Twitter have open sourced components of their software. They also
fund and support the development of open source communities. By embracing open source projects and harnessing their power, we bring to the company a fresh
outlook that bolsters rapid, but stable change.
