===================
Automated Testing
===================

As stated earlier, all software developed internally must be developed using
the TDD paradigm. The test scripts **must** be automated. Manual testing
of products internally is to be avoided at all costs.

Hence, every project that is pushed into the SCM will have to be configured
with the automated testing system, so that the tests can run at a preconfigured
time for all branches.

This ensures that tests are constantly run, and their results are logged.
