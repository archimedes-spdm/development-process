    Requirements Gathering Template
    ===============================================

Once a customer approaches a developer for a task, the following
questions must be answered.

1. Is this a new program?
2. Is this a new feature into an existing program?

Depending upon these questions, the developer must ask the customer as much
detail as possible about the task at hand.
This must include, but not be limited to, the following:

1. How often will this solution be used?
#. What sort of end result is the customer expecting?
#. Is it an improvement to an existing process?
#. Does the program require a graphical user interface?
#. Does the program have user judgement involved, or can it be completely automated given a bunch of initial input?
#. Does the program deal with proprietary formats that can only be read with third-party software?
#. Does the program deal with data formats of over 1 GB in size?
#. Does the program deal with data formats of over 100 GB in size?
#. Does the program deal with data formats of over 1 TB in size?
#. How long does the current process take?
#. Does the program deal with non-standard engineering formulae?
#. Does the program deal with unique input data formats, which are non-standard, such as an MS Excel spreadsheet with some specific schema?
#. Can said schema be better designed, or is the schema inflexible?
#. Can the program directly use a file format that is output from another program?
#. Does the program deal with text-based file formats?

These questions, and any additional questions must be recorded in the task
management system. It is the responsibility of the developer to explain these
questions to the customer and capture their exact requirements before
the task is defined.

.. note::

    These questions should be as exhaustive as possible, so as to capture the
    unique requirements comprehensively. These assist the judgement of the
    developer to assess what technology to use while starting the task.
