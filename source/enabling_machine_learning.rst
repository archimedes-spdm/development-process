Afterword: Enabling Machine Learning
======================================

The process outlined in this entire document has stayed away from the topics of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning.
That is with due cause. AI/ML have little to do with the process from a holistic standpoint but they are matters of concern
as a company. Additionally, that problem is largely out of the scope of this document.

The world at large is changing and software evolves with it. Continuous Integration, Continuous Deployment and Test-Driven
Development enable engineers to seize every chance they have to learn from the data without affecting production grade
systems. With an infrastructure that enables these principles, anyone looking for newer methods to do things, newer
ways to harness the power of AI/ML can do so with ease, knowing that the commits they push to the source code repository 
will not bring the systems down.

To enable your engineers to utilize machine learning and data analysis in their work, a company simply needs to provide the freedom to experiment.
As will be explained in the next section, investing money into licenses and tools will not help. Instead, allowing users to use the tools they need,
freely, will bolster their learning process and help them understand data better. It is **too early** to invest in a data-science platform. The landscape
is changing constantly, and it is enough that users have access to the basic tools, such as a freely accessible and **distributed version control system**,
the programming language of their choice.

.. admonition:: Regarding Data Science Programming Languages

    R, Scala and Python have become the defacto languages of choice in the data science world. Both are equally powerful, R excels in some places, Python in others.
    Scala provides speed, but not necessarily of development. Each of them have benefits.
    
    It is enough that users have access to the languages they need, because no programming language worth its measure in code is paid. They are free, free as in air.

There **are** platforms such as **IBM DSX**, **SAS** and **Stata** that help data scientists and analysts, but **they are not really required**.
The Data Science platform and general programming platform are very, very different. Programmers are by nature accepting of terminals and text editors.
Data Scientists might be more comfortable in an IDE customized for their needs. However, investing in a single tool will solve nothing. Each data scientist
will have a separate requirement, and this decision is best left to their own usecases and businesses. In this author's opinion, IDEs get in the way of the real work.
