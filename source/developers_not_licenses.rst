After-Afterword: Inhouse Development Benefits

    What follows is largely a personal opinion. It can be argued that code shouldn't be developed inhouse, especially
    when high stakes are concerned, and that paying for a license, and thereby offloading the responsibility enables
    a company to take one weight off its shoulders. However, there is a lot to be said for being able to develop 
    your own software in today's world. It enables rapid change.

    This entire section is mostly a love-song to developing code inhouse, building software products with the same
    vigour and tenacity that fuelled the industrial revolution, for instance. It may be skipped if that sort of thing,
    *i.e.* passion, bores you.

    **"Not all engineering companies are software companies."**

That line of thought is a valid argument. Developing software is serious business. **Not all companies need to write their
own software.** This author completely agrees with this. However, there is an argument for a *semantically loose* converse.

..

    **"All companies need to be able to write their own software, when they need to."**

Software that concerns business logic needs to be developed inhouse. It requires years of understanding of the business process,
continuous improvements and additional features. While there are software that can be *customized* to suit a company's needs,
oftentimes, it is better to write core functionality inhouse. Customizing readily-available software also needs to be conducted
in lines with production-grade software practises, as outlined in the :ref:`practises` section earlier.

Outsourcing Software Work
-----------------------------

A company should view the software it uses internally to enable and orchestrate business logic as a core knowledge. Just because a company does not
sell software does not mean it should not invest in software development.

Think of it this way. Small engineering tasks are outsourced, but never drastic design-changing decisions. Why?

The software that empowers a business must be deployed, maintained and, if possible, developed entirely inhouse. This is very critical because in today's world,
software is a unique form of currency. It is not that we must shun all commercial software. No. There are software we cannot write. However, there is a lot of software
we can and should write internally. Outsourcing core business software ensures that the knowledge of its innate features is never capitalized. The things we could
glean from developing such software internally is lost to a third-party company.
