Source Code Management
=======================

**All source code must be under version control.**

.. admonition:: Future Prospects
    :admonition: note
    
    For the foreseeable future, Subversion is used for version control in this
    team. `The server is hosted here. <svn://dllohsr222.driveline.gkn.com/>`_

    After the team grows to 3-4 developers, Gitlab-CE will be evaluated and
    deployed alongside subversion. Code will continue to be hosted in both
    locations, but developers will commit only to Gitlab.
