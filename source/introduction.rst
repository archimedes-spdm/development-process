    This document was drafted to illustrate a starting point for software development
    at GKN PLC. It was prepared by `Vinay Keerthi <mailto:vinay.keerthi@gkndriveline.com>`_
    working for the GKN Driveline Global Expert Network team, and the contents herein are subject
    to change.

This document serves as a guide to software development practises followed at GKN PLC. It outlines the practises followed,
and can be considered as a *guideline*. It is neither the purpose of this document nor the ideal of its author that these
are concrete and inflexible. Insofar as its contents, this document hopes to help software developers find a waypoint, in
a manner of speaking. It can also be considered as a **Requirements Document**, showcasing the way we must go forward in 
order to make an impact in the way we work. All work needs to be defined, and this document hopes to one day serve as an
exhaustive internal document, describing the processes we follow for every kind of work that arises.

The contents herein were drafted as an effort to crystallize a process for software development, one that can be used at
a global level. The contents therein are nothing new, they are followed in many software development companies, but setting
them here helps us visualize the process we hope to build, *first by definition*, then **bolstered by practise**.
