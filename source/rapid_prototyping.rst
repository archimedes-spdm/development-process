    This section is a point of view, aimed at discussing how to enable rapid software prototyping and development.
    It discusses **small teams**, **better accesses** and **more leeway** in choosing the right tools.

    It could be said that portions of this are opinionated, but this opinion comes as a developer.

Software Development does not need to be slow. It can be a blaze, rushing through the bushes. This document outlines how
rapid prototyping in software development can be enabled, and practised.

------------------
The Right Tools
------------------

When picking the right tools, allowing developers to choose their tools and not making this choice for them is paramount.
This is because development tools are not like other tools. The software developers know their tools, they know what sort of work
goes into them. But this is also for another reason. **Developers need the freedom to change their tools, when the moment arises.**

Software Development tools and practises change. This document is a living process description, and by nature, it is under
version control, serving as an example of how these change.

Software developers should be allowed to change with time, both to retain them within the company, and to enable them to bring in the
latest and best practises into the industry. Being hindered and held back by age old practises will get us nowhere.

--------------
Smaller Teams
--------------

Small teams that work well together can work wonders as opposed to large teams held back by communication gaps. Hiring the right people, and giving
them freedom to choose the right tools should be part of the process itself.

    "Small teams are more productive in many ways than large teams, but some best practices and experience from large teams can help small groups become even more productive."
